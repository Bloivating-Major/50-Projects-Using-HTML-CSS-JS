# 🎯 Simple Modal Project

This is a beginner-friendly modal project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — no frameworks, no libraries, just pure web magic! ✨

## 🚪 What is a Modal?

A **modal** is a popup or dialog box that appears on top of the current page. It grabs the user's attention — usually for confirmations, forms, or alerts.

This project includes:

* ✅ A button to open the modal
* ❌ A button to close it
* 🌫️ A dark overlay to focus on the popup
* 🖱️ Click outside (on the overlay) to close as well

## 💻 Demo Preview

> 🔘 Click the **"Open Modal"** button
> 💬 A modal appears in the center of the screen
> ❌ Click "Close Modal" OR the dark overlay to close it

## 📂 Project Structure

```

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

* DOM manipulation using `document.querySelector`
* Event listeners: `click`
* CSS classes toggle using `.classList.add()` / `.remove()`
* Modal centering with `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`
* `z-index` layering with overlays

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. When you click **Open Modal**:

   * The modal and overlay get a class `.open`
   * This class makes them visible (via CSS)

2. When you click **Close Modal** or **overlay**:

   * The `.open` class is removed
   * Modal disappears and overlay fades

---

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Interact with the modal! 🎉

## 🌟 Want to Extend?

Here are some ideas to upgrade this project:

* Add **animations** to fade the modal in/out
* Use a **form** inside the modal
* Trap focus inside the modal for accessibility
* Make it responsive on mobile
