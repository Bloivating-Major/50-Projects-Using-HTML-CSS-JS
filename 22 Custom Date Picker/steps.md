What will be our first step?

1. we will use a module date-fns for getting our dates.
2. we will first initialize our project with package.json
3. then we will install the module
4. and we will be using parcel for our bundler as our dev dependency
    - then we will modify start and build scripts
5. git init
6. ignore dist and node_modules and cache

7. what we will be doing is easy part 1st like open and close date picker using button and date picker
    - toggle the classlist

8. now we will create a function to set our date on the button 
    - what does the function do it will find out the actual dates and then format them accordingly
    - then we can pass it the date and it will return us the date we wanted using innerText
    
9. Now we will target out date picker header text.
