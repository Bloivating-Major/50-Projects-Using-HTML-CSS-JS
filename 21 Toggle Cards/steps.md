- Make Expand and collaspe buttons work
- We have a card object in which we see everthing
- What we have to do is simply add a show class to the card body so that it can expand

- What do we need to build?
1. User comes and clicks on expand button
2. The card expands and user clicks on collapse button and the card collapse.

- How would a real dev would approach?

- Ok so how does a dev though was instead of targeting the buttons he target's the document object itself to check for clicks
