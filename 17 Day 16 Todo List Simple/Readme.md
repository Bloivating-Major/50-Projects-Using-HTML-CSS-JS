# 📝 Simple To-Do List App

This is a minimalist To-Do list application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It lets users quickly add and remove tasks in a clean, responsive interface.

---

## ✨ Features

* ✅ Add new to-do items using a form input
* 🗑️ Click on an item to delete it from the list
* 💅 Hover effect with strikethrough and color change
* ⚡ Instant feedback without page reloads

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
simple-todo/
├── index.html     # Main HTML file
├── style.css      # Styling for the app
└── script.js      # JavaScript logic
```

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. HTML (`index.html`)

Defines the structure:

* A form with input and submit button
* A `#list` container where tasks appear

### 2. JavaScript (`script.js`)

* Captures form submission
* Dynamically creates and appends new `<div>` items
* Clears input after adding
* Deletes item on click

### 3. CSS (`style.css`)

* Basic reset and layout styles
* Adds hover effects with red color and strikethrough to indicate deletion
